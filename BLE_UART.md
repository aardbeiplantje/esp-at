# NAME

ble\_uart.pl - BLE UART (Nordic UART Service) bridge in Perl

# SYNOPSIS

**ble\_uart.pl** **\[**OPTIONS**\]** \[XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\[,option=value ...\]\[,...\]\]

# DESCRIPTION

This script connects to one or more BLE devices implementing the Nordic UART
Service (NUS), discovers the UART RX/TX characteristics, and allows simple
UART-style read/write over BLE. It is intended for use with ESP32/ESP-AT or
similar BLE UART bridges.

Input from the terminal is sent to the BLE device, and data received from the
device is printed to the terminal with a distinct prompt and color. Multiple
connections can be managed interactively.

# NORDIC UART SERVICE (NUS)

This script communicates with BLE devices that implement the Nordic UART Service
(NUS), a standard BLE service for serial-style data transfer over Bluetooth Low
Energy. NUS is commonly used on Nordic Semiconductor devices (such as
nRF52/nRF53 series) and is supported by many ESP32 BLE UART firmware projects,
including ESP-AT.

NUS provides a simple way to send and receive data as if over a UART/serial
port, but using BLE characteristics for RX (write) and TX (notify). This allows
wireless, bidirectional, low-latency communication between a host (like this
script) and a BLE device.

## NUS Service and Characteristics

The Nordic UART Service uses the following UUIDs:

- Service UUID: `6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`
- TX Characteristic (notify, device to client): `6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`
- RX Characteristic (write, client to device): `6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`

The host writes data to the RX characteristic, and receives notifications from
the TX characteristic.

For more information, see the official Nordic documentation:

# ARGUMENTS

The script expects one or more Bluetooth addresses of BLE devices implementing
the Nordic UART Service (NUS). Additional options like \`uart\_at=0\` can be
specified to disable UART AT command mode.

The format is:

    XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX[,option=value][,...]

Where:

- XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

    The Bluetooth address of the device to connect to.

- option=value

    An optional configuration option

    - **uart\_at=0|1**

        disable UART AT command mode. If set to 0, the script will not
        send \`AT\` commands and will not expect \`OK\` responses. Default is 1 (enabled).

    - **bt\_listen\_addr=BDADDR\_ANY|BDADDR\_LOCAL|XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX**

        local Bluetooth address to listen on (default: BDADDR\_ANY).

    - **security\_level=none|low|medium|high|fips**

    - **io\_capability=display-only|display-yesno|keyboard-only|no-input-output|keyboard-display**

        IO capability for BLE pairing for this specific connection.

    - **pin=NNNN**

        4-6 digit PIN for BLE pairing authentication for this specific connection.
